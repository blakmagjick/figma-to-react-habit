# Practising Figma Design to React Frontend

Recently got some advice about skills that I should work on that would help with the hunt for my first job as a developer. 
-- Learn how to take a Figma design file, and translate it into React code. 

Asked a friend for a Fimga file from their current project, since I'm no designer by any means, and got started.

Here's my progress so far on the left.
